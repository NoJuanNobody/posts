#It's Okay to Screw Up

That was what our instructor tried to explain to us as we sat  in the afternoon lecture. it is almost mid-way through the second week and The eager and bright eyed group of 27 students has quickly shown lackluster. Here at ZipCode Wilmington They will Push you to the limit, and I really do feel that. The lack of sleep, is often overwritten by the intense drive and need to preform. so after we worked ourselves to the bone for a week, with seemingly no payoff...it no wonder we were not raising our hands any more. 

> It is okay to fail.

**Sure but what the hell does that mean?**

Michael pointed out something that I think is extremely eye opening. our entire lives, all the way through our education, we were always expected so do the opposite of fail. Very often We were expected to get perfect scores...does anyone remember the SAT? GPA?

I remember when I was studying engineering at UD there was a saying that used to go around. there are the types of Mechies who are smart, brilliant even, where they simply understand the concepts very quickly. and there is the other engineer... Problem Solver who looks at the problem as a challenge, and commits. He says, **"ok, I dont care how long it takes, I am going to figure this out.**

I have been of the latter category, and it has benifited me enought that I can sometimes even fake being the former. but in reality in the Software Development world, you have to be willing to fail so that you can succeed. its a cyclic process. 

> FIRST THING I WANT YOU TO DO IS FAIL...AND FAIL HARD...AND FAIL FAST. 

looking back I can now understand what was going on this first week. it was painful. but I can safely say that If we got through that as a group, and we know more about the software engineering world than we did a week and a half ago...then that is a success. they say shoot for the stars and you might reach the moon. maybe there are some aspects to this as well. 

###and so this makes me wonder...
why is it that we have a school system set in a way that discourages failure, to the point that it is even embarassing and that students are asked to leave because of it? 

The trick is, when you do fail, you need to take a step back and understand **why** did you fail in the first place?
