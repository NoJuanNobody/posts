#Function over everything
##how being lazy can lead to an optimized lifestyle

I recently had a conversation with a coleague of mine where he made a joke about how particular I am in my workspace, and how some of my behavior comes of as slightly eccentric. Its not like i am bothered about the concrete space in particular, but over my career as a Jr. web Developer I slowly became vary particular in the way that I did things. I just want to talk about a few reasons why.

When I studied architecture I was told in my studio classes about the idea of having a practice. Michael Riscica wrote an [article](http://youngarchitect.com/2015/11/22/architecture-is-a-practice/) about this idea, and its basically stating that, in order to get good at something, you need to break that thing apart, and do it over and over and over again. you need to be meticulous about every aspect of that discipline. let me restate that. You need to **put a sense of disipline into your disipline of choice.** Dancers spend hours stretching be able to strike certain poses. They might spend even more time conditioning to gain the stregnth to move into that pose. after practicing every single aspect of each movement and each particular element of the pose, That dancer has achieved the ability to do something that most of us can't do, she can dance effortlessly, **but we never see all of the effort that she puts into it.**

Architects, Athletes, Artists, are all considered artistic, and it is easy to consider these areas as a craft. but maybe we all need to consider what we do as professionals not just a career, **but we should also consider our selves as Craftsmen who are praticing and working towards a craft.**

[There is an entire movement](http://www.craftsmanperspective.com/history/) around this idea in the 19th century, that while factory workers work for their superior, craftsmen also work for themselves, the product that they create is something that they are proud of, and they gain a sense of worth from the things that they create. alot of this idea of the maker and what he can do for his enjoyment, lead to the design and construction of the [Red House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_House,_London) during the industrial revolution. it was a house that celebrated its design through its details, and benifited workers as well as the end user, or the owner of the house. 

Software Development is no different. in a way the software we write is like a bunch of Red Houses. everyone has their own strengths and areas of expertise, and we colaborate together to learn from each other, share ideas and build something technically beautiful that serves a utilitarian purpose.

as a Jr. front end web dev, I did alot with customer facing adds in the digital space. [Basically I made landing pages](http://lp2.ericksonliving.com/spring_floorplan_campaign/index.php?from=APL#main/1) and lots of them. when you get into the repitition of building a similar thing, over and over again, you begin to realize that you are often spending 3 hours on the config of your project, rather than getting to the actual decisions that matter. **this is when I finally understood the use of boilerplate code.** after about 3 months I began to notice a definite style, pattern in which the designers in the marketing department approached the majority of their designs. I also realized i was using the same fonts, the same tools and often the same code. My conclusion was to build my own boilerplate repo. this included Sass files, css, html structured files for all cases of what the marketing department might want to build lists of prewritten CSS to add fonts into my Sass files on the fly as well as prewritten Sass to implement in what my mind was an opinionated framework so that I could start to solve other problems in my job. 

when I began to think outside of the box I realized the minor difference between developers and dancers: dancers have to train continuously and repeadedly to maintain and extend their abilities. As an engineer, if you wish to extend the capabilities of what you can do as a programmer, we can literally write solutions and algotythms to do that for you. this is where tasks like grunt and gulp.js come in. Do i understand it? **heck no.** do i want to? **YAAAAASSS**

###When Technology that you use does not get in the way that you use it.

I take this same approach to Software engineering. If there is something that I have done more than once, I find a way to create a structured bare bones version of code and the snippet in a txt file so that i can `cat *.txt` the syntax in my terminal later for reference. I am literally this close to collecting a java syntax library that you can `cat` the syntax for any possible case when you are in a pinch. 

if you know where everything is on your lap top, where each asigned workspace involves a designed task, you remember to swipe right on your mac to bring up your work, you swipe two left to bring up your search work space, so on and so forth, the computer becomes an extention of your brain, and your ability to code becomes your discipline, your martial art. **you begin to dance with code**

##Oh and by the way I am also lazy
this method of exsisting, being intentional with all the movements that matter, and automating everything else, it seems like an enormous task. why the hell would a lazy person do all of this?? some say **you work very hard.** but i dont think that is necessarily even related to what is going on here. the truth is **I work smart.**

a common metaphor for the workplace is that you are a hole digger who digs a hole with a hand shovel, if you get really good at digging holes, most people thing that will lead to promotion. but that is not necesarily true, what that leads to most likely is your boss giving you more holes to dig, and that your value as a hole digger may be more of a resource than a  Excavating manager. 

but there is nothing stopping you from designing an engineering a CAT excavator. or even a fully automated machine that excavates when you press a button, so that you can go catch up on **Game of thrones.**

the point i am trying to make here is this. save your work, build on that work, develop a style based on previous code. become a super user. the things that you will be able to acomplish will be astounding when you think about the problem instead of the syntax. half of the reason why I am writing these opinion peices is so I can get them out of my head so i can keep up with the break-neck pace of ZipCode Wilmington.

Michael Cane said something again in class, and it is kind of the reason why I wrote this whole post. he was mentioning the 10000 hours idea, that if you spend[ 1000 hours on something you will be considered an expert, but just 20 hours ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8197102) the link is a discussion board on that topic, and the actual hours vary because it is for the most part qualitative...no one has empirical date to prove otherwise. 

what i want to add to this is, its not really 10000 hours, or 1000 hours, or even 100 doing one thing, but instead spending certain parts of those hours practicing certain parts of that process, and eventually sum the processes into a cumulative discipline of what you like. what makes software engineering different is the whole idea of boilerplate. with saved preferences config files and automation, if you operate with the idea of boilerplate in mind, the hours that you can spend total will exponentially increase. 

let me explain. with every boilerplate, config file, and automation script you run and rely on, you extend the amount of practice you recieve per hour. **by the tim you get to 10,000 hours you may be well on your way to 100,000 or even 1,000,000** you have trancended the expert range. 

if you work your hardest, ZipCode can consist of 1200 hours of participation in the program. with the idea of having a practice: setting your hours, setting preferences and developing your own style, you can be much closer to 10,000 than 1000. either way, ZipCode can get you to a point you never thought possible.
