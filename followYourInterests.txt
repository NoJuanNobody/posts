You know, that's a damn good point, and it's along the same lines as the people who complain that no one ever mentions free trade school (which we should absolutely do). If you major in something that isn't marketable, you should have to foot the bill, along with the usual loans and scholarships for help. Everyone who chooses to go to trade school or majors in STEM in college should have their education paid for because it really is an investment in the economy.
